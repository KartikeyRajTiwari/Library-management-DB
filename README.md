# Library-management-DB
A library is a collection of organized information and
resources which is made accessible to a well-defined community for borrowing
or reference sake. The collection of the resources and information are provided
in digital or physical format in either a building/room or in a virtual space or
even both. Libraryâ€™s resources and collections may include newspapers, books,
films, prints, maps, CDs, tapes, videotapes, microform, database etc. The main
aim of this system is to develop a new programmed system that will conveying
ever lasting solution to the manual base operations and to make available a
channel through which staff can maintain the record easily and customers can
access the information about the library at whatever place they might find
themselves.
Library Management System allows the user to store the book details and the
customer details. The system is strong enough to withstand regressive yearly
operations under conditions where the database is maintained and cleared over a
certain time of span. The implementation of the system in the organization will
considerably reduce data entry, time and also provide readily calculated reports.

This project is the backend database structure of a library management system. It may be used to manage any commercial library/group of librararies.
OBJECTIVE: - It keeps track of all the information about the books in the
library, their cost, status and total number of books available in the Library. The
user will find it easy in this automated system rather than using the manual
writing system. The system contains a database where all the information will
be stored safely.
